  abstract = {AbstractThe recent emergence of building information modeling (BIM) and the evolution of virtual design and construction (VDC) in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry are fundamentally changing the process by which buildings are designed and constructed. However, the perceived high initial cost of implementing BIM has deterred many industry professionals from adopting this technology. This paper aims to facilitate the decision-making process in the adoption of BIM by presenting the cost savings associated with implementing BIM. In many cases, an owner’s willingness to pay for the BIM is crucial in the contractor’s decision to use BIM. Therefore, in order to show the returns on the investment (ROI) of paying additional fees, data was gathered from three case studies on three sets of similar projects, with each set consisting of one recently constructed BIM-assisted project and one earlier, similar project completed without BIM. The potential savings to an owner choosing to invest ...},

The paper presents a governance approach for managing multi-actor, multi-discipline, and total lifecycle data, informed by a wide industry consultation conducted in the UK between March and September 2011. The study identifies a number of barriers in engaging with Building Information Modelling (BIM) efforts with a view of facilitating collaboration around a common and integrated project specification. A governance model is proposed that addresses the identified adoption blockers underpinned by a “mixed approach”, that factors in various modes of information delivery, ranging from paper-based documents to object-based information conveyed by IFC (Industry Foundation Classes). A demonstrator system is developed and used to validate our BIM governance concepts. Our governance model is discussed in the context of the recent UK gover...},

An increase in the availability of cost-benefit information will be significant, as one of the primary motivators for professionals in the building industry to adopt new technologies is the opportunity for direct benefits in their own operations. This paper presents  findings from an industry-wide online survey that was carried out in the spring of 2009. The study aims to understand the perceived value of BIM in the U.S. building industry, as seen by various participants in the industry. The survey specifically focuses on tangible benefits and costs associated with BIM use at the project level.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, rapid technological development into acquiring geo-spatial information; joined to the capabilities to process these data in a relative short period of time, allows the generation of detailed 3D textured city models that will become an essential part of the modern city information infrastructure (Spatial Data Infrastructure) and, can be used to integrate various data from different sources for public accessible visualisation and many other applications. One of the main bottlenecks, which at the moment limit the use of these datasets to few experts, is a lack on efficient visualization systems through the web and interoperable frameworks that allow standardising the access to the city models. The work presented in this paper tries to satisfy these two requirements developing a 3D web-based visualization system based on OGC standards and effective visualization concepts. The architectural framework, based on Services Oriented Architecture (SOA) concepts, provides the 3D city data to a web client designed to support the view process in a very effective way. The first part of the work is to design a framework compliant to the 3D Portrayal Service drafted by the of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) 3D standardization working group. The latter is related to the development of an effective web client able to render in an efficient way the 3D city models.},
